# Arduino Pushbutton Control for Three LEDs
This project utilizes an Arduino board to read input from three pushbuttons connected to a single pin, and uses that input to control three LEDs. The project is designed to be a simple and fun way to learn about electronics and programming with Arduino.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have an Arduino board and the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You'll also need three pushbuttons, three LEDs, and some jumper wires to connect everything together.

Once you have everything set up, you can upload the code in this repo to your Arduino board and start experimenting with the pushbuttons and LEDs.

# How it Works
The Arduino board reads input from the three pushbuttons connected to a single pin using a technique called "digital input". When a button is pressed, the Arduino detects the change in voltage and sends a signal to the code running on the board.

The code then uses a series of conditional statements to determine which button was pressed, and uses that information to turn on the corresponding LED.
